							TLDR: Prognosis is a web app that predicts your risk of getting
							diseases with machine learning.
						</p>
						<div>
							<p className="my-4">
								Common health conditions like heart diseases and diabetes are
								highly treatable if caught early. However not everyone have
								access to routine medical checkups due to regional availability
								or limited financial capabilities. Hence Project Prognosis
								intends to merge disease identification and preventive
								healthcare into a simple to use, free and open source web app to
								be used by everyone.
							</p>
							<p className="my-4">
								Using machine learning, we are able to identify diseases based
								on the user’s lifestyle data which they’ve inputted into our web
								interface. We will return a risk report for the user as well as
								some advice to prevent the progression of said diseases.
							</p>
							<p className="my-4">
								Other than that we have a psychiatric chat bot named Murphy who
								is trained to interact with people suffering from mental
								distress.
							</p>
							<p className="my-4">
								With the open source community we plan to further integrate more
								disease prediction and identification into a free to use
								framework for the general public.
